# String Calculator

Write a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations on a string of numbers. Here is an outline of the requirements:

1. Create a class called "StringCalculator" with a method called "Add" that takes a string as an input.

2. The "Add" method should return 0 if the input string is empty.

3. If the input string contains a single number, the "Add" method should return that number.

4. If the input string contains multiple numbers, separated by a comma or newline, the "Add" method should return the sum of those numbers.

5. The "Add" method should handle negative numbers, and throw an exception if any negative numbers are found in the input string.

6. The "Add" method should ignore numbers greater than 1000.

7. The "Add" method should support custom delimiters, indicated by a "//" prefix before the numbers.
